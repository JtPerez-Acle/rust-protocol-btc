# Development Plan

## Rules for Marking Tasks Complete
1. A task can be marked complete by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
2. All tests for the task must pass before marking complete
3. Code must be reviewed by at least one other developer
4. Documentation must be updated to reflect changes
5. No known bugs or security issues remain
